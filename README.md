# Merge-Sort and Parallelization
## Introduction
This project was built along with the Laboratory Algorithms and Data Structures at the Technical University of Applied Sciences of Regensburg, Bavaria, Germany. Also, it simulates the Merge-Sort with and without the parallelization, and measures the time-complexity for different concepts (functions) of Merge-Sort.
