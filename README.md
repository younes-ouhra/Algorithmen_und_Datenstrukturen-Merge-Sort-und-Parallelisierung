# Merge-Sort and Parallelization
## Introduction
This project was built along with the Laboratory Algorithms and Data Structures at the Technical University of Applied Sciences of Regensburg, Bavaria, Germany. Also, it simulates the Merge-Sort with and without the parallelization, and measures the time-complexity for different concepts (functions) of Merge-Sort.

* <b>The mergesort-Function</b>: This function is about merge-sorting the elements recursivlly.
* The simplemerge-Function: This function sorts two already-sorted list of elements and merge them to a new result list.
* The pmerge-Function: This Function gets two different lists of elements and has the concept of threat each list separately by inserting each element of a list in the right position of the result list. For that reason the function calls the two functions qualabove and equalbelow.
